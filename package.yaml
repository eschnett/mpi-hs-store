synopsis: MPI bindings for Haskell
description: |
  MPI (the [Message Passinag Interface](https://www.mpi-forum.org)) is
  a widely used standard for distributed-memory programming on HPC
  (High Performance Computing) systems. MPI allows exchanging data
  (_messages_) between programs running in parallel. There are several
  high-quality open source MPI implementations (e.g. MPICH, MVAPICH,
  OpenMPI) as well as a variety of closed-source implementations.
  These libraries can typically make use of high-bandwidth low-latency
  communication hardware such as InfiniBand.
  
  This library @mpi-hs@ provides Haskell bindings for MPI. It is based
  on ideas taken from
  [haskell-mpi](https://github.com/bjpop/haskell-mpi),
  [Boost.MPI](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/doc/html/mpi.html)
  for C++, and [MPI for
  Python](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
  
  @mpi-hs@ provides two API levels: A low-level API gives rather
  direct access to the actual MPI API, apart from certain "reasonable"
  mappings from C to Haskell (e.g. output arguments that are in C
  stored via a pointer are in Haskell regular return values). A
  high-level API simplifies exchanging arbitrary values that can be
  serialized.

  Note that the automated builds on
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org) will currently always fail
  since no system MPI library is present there. However, builds on
  [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org) should succeed -- if not, there
  is an error in this package.
